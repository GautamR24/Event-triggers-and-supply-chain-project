##  Project Workflow

The Project Workflow is as follows :-

- A new item will be given by the user.
- this item with it's name will be added to the blockchain.
- After the addition to the blockchain an address will be generated.
- When another user want to buy an item it will pay to it's generated address.
- Once the item is  paid event will be triggered for dispatching.
- Once the item is paid the owner can withdraw the money deposited.
